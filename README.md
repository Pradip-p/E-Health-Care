# E-Health-Care
The web app which is used to remove the dependencies on the doctors, to help out the poor and helpless people with the normal medical checkup and to help people avoid paying huge amount to doctor unnecessarily. This project is made with Django, machine learning algorithms and deep learning (ANN and CNN).
## Overview
In todays time we see a lot of the shortage of the doctors in the world especially in NEPAL.A lot of people are suffering a lot without the help of the proper medical checkup.Also most of the cases many cases arise leading to dealth due to lack of timely medical checkup
So to cope up with all of those problems this app is designed which would prove its benefits upto much extent.
